# gt-files

Various files for starting up and running GT.

Caveat: These files are configured for my own personal use. You'll have to adapt them to your own environment.

# Overview:

- getGt.command : build GT, install some script, and create a zipped backup
- startGt.command : start GT from a Terminal, so any errors are logged there
- startup.st : Pharo script to initialize my environment when launching GT

- CopyScripts.command
- findDuplicates.command
