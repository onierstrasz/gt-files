# gt-files

Various files for starting up and running GT.

Caveat: These files are configured for my own personal use. You'll have to adapt them to your own environment.

# Overview:

- [getGt.command](https://github.com/onierstrasz/gt-files/blob/main/getGt.command) : build GT, install some script, and create a zipped backup
- [startGt.command](https://github.com/onierstrasz/gt-files/blob/main/startGt.command) : start GT from a Terminal, so any errors are logged there
- [startup.st](https://github.com/onierstrasz/gt-files/blob/main/startup.st) : Pharo script to initialize my environment when launching GT
- [CopyScripts.command](https://github.com/onierstrasz/gt-files/blob/main/CopyScripts.command) : Copy startup command and script to downloaded release images.
